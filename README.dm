1. Assessment 1B Software process practiceThe NEXT.js technology stack must be used because I have developers with expertise in this stack 
   who will continue development and maintenance of the product after you.
2. I will keep in touch with you using the MS Teams channel mainly and will visit face-to-face when I can.
3. Product name: Software Practice Empirical Evidence Database (SPEED)
4. The product should be available as a web app on any device
5. We cannot provide links to published articles â€“ they are the copyright of the publisher
6. I first just want to test the idea out with some practitioners so only need limited functionality initially. I need to work out what 
  the minimum product features will be and discuss this with you as the priority to work on first. I am NOT expecting all features to be 
  finished by the end of your initial contract.
